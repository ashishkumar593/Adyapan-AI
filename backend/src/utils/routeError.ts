/**
 * Consistent error handling for route handlers that respond directly instead of
 * delegating to the central `errorHandler` middleware.
 *
 * It fixes two long-standing problems with the ad-hoc `catch` blocks that used
 * to live in the route files:
 *   1. The caught error was discarded, so failures were swallowed silently and
 *      were impossible to debug. It is now always logged server-side.
 *   2. Every failure was reported as a generic HTTP 500, masking client errors
 *      such as validation (400), auth (401) or rate-limit (429) failures that
 *      are thrown as `httpError`s further down the stack. The original status
 *      code and message are now propagated to the client.
